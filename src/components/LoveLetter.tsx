              My Dearest Little Chick,
            </p>
            
            <p>
              As I sit here thinking about you on your special day, my heart overflows with 
              so much love that words seem insufficient. You've brought colors to my world 
              that I never knew existed, and joy that I never thought possible.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Every day with you feels like a gift. Your laugh is my favorite sound, 
              your smile is my favorite sight, and your happiness is my favorite mission. 
              You have this incredible way of making ordinary moments feel extraordinary, 
              just by being you.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              I love how you see the world with such wonder and kindness. I love your 
              cute little habits, the way you scrunch your nose when you're thinking, 
              and how you make everything better just by being there. You truly are 
              my little chick - precious, adorable, and absolutely perfect.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              On this birthday, I want you to know that you are cherished beyond measure. 
              You are my best friend, my greatest love, and my biggest blessing. I can't 
              wait to celebrate many more birthdays with you, creating countless more 
              beautiful memories together.
            </p>
